        We will approve link requests from these organizations if we determine that: (a) the link
        would not reflect unfavorably on us or our accredited businesses (for example, trade
        associations or other organizations representing inherently suspect types of business, such
        as work-at-home opportunities, shall not be allowed to link); (b)the organization does not
        have an unsatisfactory record with us; (c) the benefit to us from the visibility associated
        with the hyperlink outweighs the absence of Photomy; and (d) where the link is in the
        context of general resource information or is otherwise consistent with editorial content in
        a newsletter or similar product furthering the mission of the organization.
